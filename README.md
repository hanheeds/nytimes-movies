# Data Engineering Project for Beginners — Batch edition

This final data engineering project is brought to us by Start Data Engineering(SDE). While they seem to reference just a basic CSV file about movie reviews, a better option might be to go to the New York Times Developers Portal and use their API to pull live movie reviews. Use SDE’s framework and customize it for your own needs.

SDE has done a superior job of breaking this project down like a recipe. They tell you exactly what tools you need and when they are going to be required for your project. They list out the prerequisites you need:

Docker
Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
Airflow
In this example, SDE shows you how to set up Apache Airflow from scratch rather than using the presets. You will also be exposed to tools such as:

Amazon S3
Amazon Redshift
IAM
There are many components offered, so when you are out there catching the attention of potential future employers, this project will help you detail the in-demand skills employers are looking for.
